# DEPRECATED PROJECT

This project was used in 2016, but the NGPVAN api has changed since then.  We recommend using the
[Parsons NGPVAN api](https://move-coop.github.io/parsons/html/ngpvan.html) ([and code](https://github.com/move-coop/parsons/)) as a good replacement.

At time-of-writing (Aug 2020), NGPVAN says: "email APIDevelopers@ngpvan.com for more info and if you're working on DNC VoteBuilder then reach out to your admin about access to the Phoenix system"


# NGPVAN API (DEPRECATED)

This project is a Python wrapper for <a href="http://developers.ngpvan.com/van-api">NGPVAN API</a>. To use, you'll need API keys from NGPVAN.

## Installation

To install, simple download the package directory and add it to your project. Not yet available via pip install.

## Example Use

```
from ngpvan_api.event import NGPVANEventAPI
from ngpvan_api.canvass import NGPVANCanvassAPI

ngpvan_event_api = NGPVANEventAPI({
    'NGPVAN_BASE_URL': 'https://api.securevan.com/v4/',
    'NGPVAN_API_KEY': 'api-key-example|1',
    'NGPVAN_API_APP': 'api-app',
})

events = ngpvan_event_api.get_events_by_type_name('Canvass').get('events')

for event in events:
    signups = ngpvan_event_api.get_signups_for_event(event.get('eventId'), params={'role':'Participant'}).get('signups')

ngpvan_canvass_api = NGPVANCanvassAPI({
    'NGPVAN_BASE_URL': 'https://api.securevan.com/v4/',
    'NGPVAN_API_KEY': 'api-key-example|1',
    'NGPVAN_API_APP': 'api-app',
})

sample_vanid = 100998877
sample_activist_code = 112233
sample_survey_question = 223344
sample_survey_question_response = 334455
input_type_api = 11
canvass_type = 9
canvass_result_nothome = 1

ngpvan_canvass_api.post_data(sample_vanid,
	[ sample_activist_code ],
	[{ 'question_id': sample_survey_question, 'response_id': sample_survey_question_response }],
	input_type_api, canvass_type, '2017-01-01')

ngpvan_canvass_api.post_noncanvass(sample_vanid, canvass_result_nothome)

```

## Conventions

Every API request returns a dict with two properties:

* `results` is a list of all HTTP requests and responses made to fulfill the request.
* The name of the second property changes depending on the request type. For get requests, it will be the type of thing being requested, e.g. `get_events()` returns a dict with an `events` property, a list of events. For create (POST) requests, the ID of the created object is returned, e.g. `create_event()` returns a dict with an `event_id` property, a single ID value.

Requests that return paged results take an optional `page_number` parameter. If provided, only the given page number of results will be returned. By default, if no `page_number` is provided, all available pages will be requested and returned.

## Contributions

This does not yet cover every API call available. Contributions of additional endpoints are welcome, as are any other improvements related to the project goal of easing interaction with the NGPVAN API.
